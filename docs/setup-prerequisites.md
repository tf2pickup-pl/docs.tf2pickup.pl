## Introduction

Currently all tf2pickup.org instances use reverse proxy server configuration based on [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) for obtaining free certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). They are hosted on Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12), but the deployment is not limited to these Linux distributions only; we support the usage of different reverse proxies, such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy) or different tools for obtaining certificates such us [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) or even [win-acme](https://www.win-acme.com/). We have confirmed the website to be working on Windows 10/11 with Docker containers using [Linux Subsystem for Windows (version 2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

The following guide should be taken as an example, which is based on:

- Ubuntu 22.04 Linux distribution,
- Cloudflare as a domain API provider for DNS zone dynamic updates,
- Certbot as the certificate obtaining tool,
- Nginx as a reverse proxy,
- tf2pickup.org client and server hosted as containers on ports TCP 3000 for the server and TCP 4000 for the client. Ports can be customized.

Following these instructions should lead to configuration assessed as [A+ in Qualsys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=tf2pickup.eu) and [A+ in Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/tf2pickup.eu) tests. Most of the configuration examples given are based on configuration from the [tf2pickup.eu](https://tf2pickup.eu) website.

## Host recommendations

We do not have any specific info what are the specific requirements for the whole setup, since it can be run with game servers and client/server on separate hosts. However, based on our experience, we suggest to get a machine (regardless whether it is a VPS or a dedicated server) with at least 4 vCPU (virtual CPU cores, preferably dedicated cores), 8 GB of RAM and at least 80 GB of SSD-based storage. Apparently 40 GB is probably enough to run the site with 2 game servers and mumble, but in most cases that disk size or even doubled one will be bundled with previous specs in an offer. Having a **static** IPv4 is a must, IPv6 address is optional. There are different options for host network speed and we suggest to get an offer with 1 Gbit/s both sides. Obviously the site will run with less, but having worse networking speed such as 250 Mbit/s both sides will greatly decrease the download speed for any host updates/game server updates.

Our sites are run on different hostings, namely [OVH](https://ovh.com) (~~Strasbourg 🇫🇷~~, Gravelines 🇫🇷), [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) (Nuremberg 🇩🇪, Helsinki 🇫🇮), [Netcup](https://netcup.eu) (Nuremberg 🇩🇪), [MyDevil](https://www.mydevil.net/) (Warsaw 🇵🇱) and many others.

## Domain name setup

We encourage you to purchase domains in [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world/domains/dotdomains.xml) since they provide an API allowing for dynamic DNS zone updates (also, since we have experience with it, we can provide help with it at some point). If a pickup domain was not purchased on OVH nor any [domain registrar for which certbot DNS API plugin was made](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html?highlight=dns#dns-plugins), we encourage you to park the DNS zone in Cloudflare, since they provide their domain zone management services for free and their API is pretty easy to use.

In order to move a domain zone from the current site to Cloudflare, you are supposed to create an account on Cloudflare and add the domain you own. After that, you will be asked to change the nameserver (NS) entries for servers given by the Cloudflare. There are always two entries given and they should replace current entries in the domain zone.

In this specific case there were 4 NS entries and the domain owner had to change them to 2 NS entries, which are `annabel.ns.cloudflare.com` and `bradley.ns.cloudflare.com`:
![DNS nameservers list in OVH settings](/img/content/setup-prerequisites/change-dns-nameservers.png).
Those changes are applied immediately **only on current NS servers** meaning the change is going to be propagated in a time between a few minutes to even 48 hours. After propagation site owner should get an email about it and the change should look like that:
![DNS nameservers list in OVH settings with change applied](/img/content/setup-prerequisites/change-dns-nameservers-with-change-applied.png)
In that way all zone settings should be applicable from Cloudflare like on an image below:
![DNS nameservers list in OVH settings with change applied](/img/content/setup-prerequisites/dns-zone-cloudflare.png)

A pickup domain should contain at least two `A` entries, but this configuration is the most recommended:

| Entry type |        Name        |            Content            | Priority |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------:|
|     `A`    |   `tf2pickup.eu`   |       host IPv4 address       |    n/d   |
|   `AAAA`   |   `tf2pickup.eu`   |       host IPv6 address       |    n/d   |
|     `A`    | `api.tf2pickup.eu` |       host IPv4 address       |    n/d   |
|   `AAAA`   | `api.tf2pickup.eu` |       host IPv6 address       |    n/d   |
|    `CAA`   | `api.tf2pickup.eu` | `0 issuewild letsencrypt.org` |    n/d   |

Usage of AAAA entries is optional. If you do not want to handle IPv6 on Docker, feel free to actually not use these. We encourage to use [CAA entry](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/caa-record/) alongside Let's Encrypt certificates. Since most of the sites host the tf2pickup.org client, server with Mumble and the TF2 game server, we suggest not to use DNS proxying since at some point it is meaningless - it is used to hide the IP address of the host, whereas we cannot do it for the game servers, for it would add too much overhead and create latency issues.

We suggest to change the following settings in Cloudflare:

### SSL/TLS -> Edge Certificates

![always use https](/img/content/setup-prerequisites/cloudflare-always-use-https.png)

Note, we recommend to apply HSTS settings changes **after** the site deployment in order to avoid accessibility issues when certificates are not used on the website yet.

## SSL setup with Certbot

We discourage from using certbot version from the repository, since their versions are very old. EFF suggests downloading a binary manually or using the snap package. We encourage you to go for the latter, since it comes with automatic package updates, handled by the `snapd` service. At the moment of writing this guide the certbot version in the official Ubuntu repository is:

```sh
# certbot --version
certbot 0.40.0
```

while the snap version is:

```sh
# certbot --version
certbot 1.14.0
```

The certificate obtaining process is going to be based on the DNS-01 method with Cloudflare API use.

In order to install the Cerbot with Cloudflare DNS API plugin, you should execute the following commands:

```sh
# apt install snapd
# systemctl enable snapd.service
# snap install core
# snap install certbot --classic
# snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
# snap install certbot-dns-cloudflare
```

Before getting certificates, a Cloudflare API token must be prepared for that based on the instructions given in a [certbot-dns-cloudflare guide](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), with usage of the *restricted API token*. The next commands expect the token to be saved in the `/root/.secrets/cloudflare` file with file permissions of `600`.

After that, certificate should be able to be created by using the command (the `--agree-tos` and `-email` parameters must be given on a first certificate):

```sh
certbot certonly --non-interactive -d 'tf2pickup.eu' -d '*.tf2pickup.eu' --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials /root/.secrets/cloudflare --rsa-key-size 4096 --must-staple --agree-tos --email your-mailbox@you-are-really-using.com
```

There is a special case if your domain is a subdomain of `tf2pickup.org` or `tf2pickup.eu`, for instance `br.tf2pickup.org` or `au.tf2pickup.org` which you have to use for (example given is for `br.tf2pickup.org`).

```sh
certbot --nginx --non-interactive -d 'br.tf2pickup.org' -d 'api.br.tf2pickup.org' --rsa-key-size 4096 --must-staple --agree-tos --email your-mailbox@you-are-really-using.com
```

For the next certificate request you do not need to use `--agree-tos` and `--email` parameters anymore.

In case of failure most likely you:

- have invalid restricted API key,
- have Global API key with a user account email instead of the restricted API key,
- invalid file syntax,
- invalid token file permissions (not 600),
- do not have a DNS server connection working.

When the certificate is obtained, we suggest you to leave these two commands in the root crontab file (opened by a command `crontab -e` as root):

```crontab
0  1   20 * *   certbot certonly --non-interactive -d 'tf2pickup.eu' -d '*.tf2pickup.eu' --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials /root/.secrets/cloudflare --rsa-key-size 4096 --must-staple
5  1   20 * *   systemctl restart nginx
```

In that manner, the certificates will renew every 20th day of the month and every 2 months at 1:05 AM server time.

## Nginx setup

Nginx should be installed by the following command:

```sh
# apt install nginx
```

After the installation, delete all files existing in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` and execute the command below in order to generate Diffie-Hellman service file.

```sh
# openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem 4096
```

After that, (re)place the following files in their respective locations. Make sure you change the domain names/SSL certificate folder names in the configuration files:

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; # preserve client IP
                }
}
```

After placing those files, make sure to create symlinks to them in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:

```sh
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.tf2pickup.eu /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/api.tf2pickup.eu
# ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/tf2pickup.eu /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tf2pickup.eu
```

When that is done, nginx should use these configs. Execute `nginx -t` in order to check if all configuration files are valid. You should expect the following output:

```sh
# nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Otherwise, you should get a list of errors listed with file names and line numbers of the files containing the errors. Fix them and when you manage to get the test to be successful, reload the service by executing `nginx -s reload` and make sure the Nginx is started after every boot by executing `systemctl enable nginx.service`.
