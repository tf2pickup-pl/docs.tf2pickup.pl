title: Site components deployment
---

In order to allow for a quick site setup, we make use of Docker containers. That lets us set up the website (client and server with its database), gameservers and optionally a Mumble server. In order to start looking into deploying your own tf2pickup.org instance, you have to have all files specified below. Examples are based on [tf2pickup.eu](https://tf2pickup.eu) website, domain and their Discord server.

## Prerequisites

- have everything mentioned in the [reverse proxy deployment](/docs/setup-prerequisites) set up,
- have modern Docker and docker-compose version installed in your system, for docker-compose [use this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and for Docker feel free to use guides for:
  - [Ubuntu 22.04](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/),
  - [Debian 12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/),
  - [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/docker#Installation),
- prepare the following files in a separate folder, name it `tf2pickup-eu`, then place inside:
  - `.env` - stores variables needed for setting client, server, database and mumble containers up
  - `docker-compose.yml` - contains all container settings
  - `redis.conf` - contains Redis configuration
  - `gameserver_1.env` - stores settings for the first game server _(optional)_
  - `gameserver_2.env` - stores settings for the second game server _(optional)_
  - `gameserver_3.env` - stores settings for the second game server _(optional)_
  - `maps/` folder - it should contain all maps available for the game servers, `.bsp` extension _(optional)_,
  - `sourcetv1`, `sourcetv2`, `sourcetv3` folders - they will contain SourceTV demos from the pickup game servers _(optional)_,
  - `welcome_text.txt` - stores Message of the Day shown after joining Pickup Mumble server.

Files `gameserver_{1,2,3}.env` are useful if you want to host game servers on the same host as the website. There is no `gameserver_3.env` example, but in fact the file syntax is the same, so you can basically edit values and just uncomment the part of the configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file. In the same way, if you want to host 1 game server, just comment parts of the second game server and if you want to run game servers separately, just comment all parts of it in the aforementioned file.

The same rule goes for the Mumble server - if you want to run it outside Docker, aka use a local system installation, just don't provide needed configs for it and comment the part of the `docker-compose.yml` file for it.

### Setting up Steam API key

This is probably the easiest API key to get from all tasks here - open [Steam Web API Key site](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey), enter `tf2pickup.eu` in the **Domain Name** field, agree for _Steam Web API Terms of Use_ and click **Register**.

![steam-api-key-register](/img/content/site-components-deployment/steam-api-key-register.png)

Then, copy and pass **Key** value to a `STEAM_API_KEY` variable.

![steam-api-key-registered](/img/content/site-components-deployment/steam-api-key-registered.png)

### Setting up Discord bot with channels

:::tip

This step is optional. Follow these steps only if you own a Discord which is directed for the pickup community.

:::

Discord integration enables:

- pickup gather up notification on a public channel,
- substitute notifications when they are needed during a game,
- administration notifications, such as:
  - player bans,
  - player unbans,
  - skill changes,
  - player role changes,
  - player nickname changes,
  - new player registrations,
  - game force-ends,
  - tf2pickup server starts.

In order to create a bot, you have to enter the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the Applications section. Then, click **New Application**.
![discord-create-new-application](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-create-new-application.png)

Add a name for the bot and click **Create**.

![discord-name-new-application](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-name-new-application.png)

After that set the avatar for the application:

![discord-bot-add-flag](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-bot-add-flag.png)

Then go to the bot section. In the menu you can find a token, which you have to pass in the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` variable. Click **Reset Token**, enter your 2FA token and click **Yes, do it!** and note the token in your `.env` file.

You _should_ untick the Public Bot option, since you don't really want to let anybody invite this bot anywhere else than your Discord server(s) (even though it would be useless, as the bot sends connects to the specified discord server only).

![discord-disable-public-invite](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-disable-public-invite.png)

Now you should head over to the OAuth2 section and create a URL allowing you to invite the bot on a server. In the **OAuth2 URL Generator** section under _Scopes_ tick `bot` option, then tick _Manage Expressions_ under `bot permissions` options. That should create a link below. Copy and open it.

![discord-bot-generate-invite-link](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-bot-generate-invite-link.png)

There you should choose the server on which your community is. You have to have `Manage Server` permissions in order to add the bot on it. Choose the server you want from the dropdown list and click **Authorize**.

![discord-invite-bot](/img/content/discord-server-setup/discord-invite-bot.png)

After adding the bot you should configure the channels for it. Administration notifications should be sent on a channel available only for the site staff. We suggest to set permissions in a way where the staff have `View Channel` and `Read Message History` permissions and the bot has the following ones:

- `View Channel`,
- `Send Messages`,
- `Embed Links`,
- `Attach Files`,
- `Read Message History`.

The bot should have the same permissions on a channel supposed to be a place for the pickup gather up and substitute notifications. After that, you should define the rest of the Discord Bot related variables. You should look at the following things:

The Discord server name is `tf2pickup.eu` and the pickup public notifications channel is `#pickup-notifications`.

![come-play-with-us](/img/content/site-components-deployment/come-play-with-us.png)

You should also create a role for pinging players when the substitute is needed. In this example this role is called `ringer`.

![sub-needed](/img/content/overview/sub-needed.png)

The admin notifications channel is called `#pickup-notifications`.

![discord-admin-notifications-1](/img/content/overview/discord-admin-notifications.png)

Therefore, you should define the rest of Discord Bot variables just like shown below:

```env
DISCORD_GUILD=tf2pickup.eu
DISCORD_QUEUE_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL=come-play-with-us
DISCORD_QUEUE_NOTIFICATIONS_MENTION_ROLE=ringer
DISCORD_ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL=pickup-notifications
```

### Setting up Twitch stream integration

:::tip

This step is optional. Follow these steps only if you want to let people show up their streams on the main page of the pickup site.

:::

Setting it enables site users to integrate their tf2pickup accounts with Twitch, letting access their Twitch profiles through a Twitch link in an icon.

![player-profile](/img/content/common-tasks/find-profile-to-ban.png)

Moreover, it will show up all Twitch streams on a left site of the main page.

![tf2pickup-eu-with-stream](/img/content/site-components-deployment/tf2pickup.eu-with-stream.png)

Go to the [Twitch Developers console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and register your new application by clicking **Register Your Application**:

![twitch-dev-console-register-your-application](/img/content/site-components-deployment/twitch-dev-console-register-your-application.png)

Define application name as `tf2pickup.eu` with OAuth Redirect URLs as `https://api.tf2pickup.eu/twitch/auth/return`. Choose any category - the best one for that purpose would be `Website Integration`. After defining that verify that you are not a bot and save.

Then, you will see the application list. Find `tf2pickup.eu` and select **Manage**. You will be able to see the **Client ID**, the value used in `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` variable. The Client Secret will be hidden, press New Secret and confirm it in the popup. The Client Secret will show up like on the screenshot below:

![twitch-dev-console-api-settings](/img/content/site-components-deployment/twitch-dev-console-api-settings.png)

Pass this secret value to the `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` variable.

### Mumble server setup

The _tf2pickup.org_ server comes with an integrated bot that manages channels on your Mumble server. It creates a dedicated channel for every game and cleans them up when they are left empty for some time.

In order for the bot to work, you need to give him proper rights to do create, edit and remove channels. The way to do that on Mumble servers is via so-called ACLs (Access Control Lists).

First, set up your Mumble server connection details [using the admin panel](final-touches#set-up-voice-chat-settings).
After you save the settings, the bot will login and join the selected channel.

![mumble-bot-joins-server](/img/content/site-components-deployment/mumble-bot-joins-server.png)

To grant him proper privileges, first you need to register the bot. Having done that, edit channel, then select tab named _ACL_, click _Add_ and type bot's username in the lower field.
Next make sure both _Applies to sub-channels_ and _Applies to this channel_ checkboxes are selected and on the right-hand side of the window click _Allow_ checkbox next to the _Write ACL_ label.
The channel edit window should look like this:

![mumble-edit-channel-window](/img/content/site-components-deployment/mumble-channel-edit-window.png)

Press _OK_ to save the changes. The bot is supposed to create channels automatically when a game starts on the website. It will create BLU/RED subchannels in it as well. At the end of the game it will link BLU and RED channels, so both teams can communicate. The bot removes leftover channels after a game ends, provided they are empty of users.

## Giving `tf2pickup` user access to Docker commands

:::caution
This step is optional. By default, the only user allowed to utilize Docker commands is `root`.
:::
This one is simple, all you have to do is to add `tf2pickup` user to the group called `docker`:

```sh
# gpasswd -a tf2pickup docker
```

## Refreshing Mumble SSL certificates

Since Mumble is utilizing certificates being renewed by Certbot, it must refresh certificates after renewal. In that case a SIGUSR1 signal can be sent to the server, so it will not shut down completely, by adding this line to your root's crontab file:

```crontab
0 1   20 * *    docker kill --signal="SIGUSR1" tf2pickup-eu-mumble-server-1
```

## First site start

Since [RapidFort](https://hub.docker.com/u/rapidfort) images are based on [Bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami) images, they do not use root user (UID 0) in order to control the service within the container. These services are supposed to run as a user with UID 1001 (you can overwrite the ID in `docker-compose.yml`), so in order to let service work you must set a right permissions for their respective data folders and `redis.conf` configuration file.

When you have all the configuration files mentioned above ready to go, change `docker-compose.yml` in the following way:

```docker
  mongodb:
    command: sleep infinity
    image: rapidfort/mongodb:4.4
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - database-data:/bitnami/mongodb
    environment:
      - MONGODB_ROOT_USER=${MONGODB_ROOT_USER}
      - MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MONGODB_DATABASE=${MONGODB_DATABASE}
      - MONGODB_USERNAME=${MONGODB_USERNAME}
      - MONGODB_PASSWORD=${MONGODB_PASSWORD}
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    hostname: tf2pickup-eu-mongo

  redis:
    command: sleep infinity
    image: rapidfort/redis:7.0
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/bitnami/redis/data
      - ./redis.conf:/opt/bitnami/redis/etc/redis.conf
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    hostname: tf2pickup-eu-redis
```

The difference is within a parameter `command`. After that, start them two with `docker compose up -d mongodb redis`. Then change the permissions:

```sh
docker exec -i -u 0 tf2pickup-eu_mongo_1 chown -R 1001:1001 /bitnami/mongodb
docker exec -i -u 0 tf2pickup-eu_client_1 chown -R 1001:1001 /bitnami/redis/data
```

Then, set 1001:1001 permissions for `redis.conf` file:

```sh
sudo chown 1001:1001 redis.conf
```

When permissions are set, remove the `command` parameter lines from `docker-compose.yml` and and run `docker compose up -d` in order to start the entire stack. Each time you would like to stop the application stack, you are supposed to execute command `docker compose stop` and `docker compose start -d` when you start the stack. Containers have a `restart always` policy meaning the containers will always restart on fail, so it will also always start on a system boot as long as `docker.service` service is also starting on system boot.
